Rewriting greeting cards

description:
People appreciate small gestures like receiving a greeting card on special occasions, even if it is delivered
electronically. Sometimes writing this greeting takes longer than planned because it is not easy to come up
with something thoughtful. But once you do itl, why not reusing most of the text for another occasion?
For example, a congratulation email on a new car may be similar to a congratulation email on a new
house. One can copy and paste parts of the previous greeting to make it into a new greeting, but we would
like to develop software that does it for us. The problem can be formulated as follows: Given a string S of
length N>0, and a list of M pairs of strings LS, each pair representing a string to be replaced and the
second being the actual replacement, display the new string R that is obtained by replacing every
occurrence of the first string in each pair with the corresponding second string in the pair. The string
matching must be case sensitive.
